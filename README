ABOUT
=====

This is a simple tool used to syllabate Latin.  It uses ',,' as the syllable
breaker.  This can easily be mangled by RegEx for LaTeX purposes (see
http://github.com/sgharms/latintools/tree/master).

For example, it turns:

"Arma virumque cano, trojae qui primus ab oris"

into:

"Ar,,ma ,,vi,,rum,,que ,,ca,,no, ,,tro,,jae ,,qui ,,pri,,mu,,s a,,b o,,ris"

From this, you can start inserting notations for \macron or \breve if you use
the metre package, or you can use \={.} wrapping.      

Elisions between "um...a" or "(vowel)...(vowel)" are also handled and wrapped in
LaTeX's \sout{} command.   For example:

"Litora multum ille et terris jactatus et alto"

becomes:

"Li,,to,,ra ,,mul,,t\sout{um }il,,l____et ,,ter,,ris ,,jac,,ta,,tu,,s e,,t al,,to"


STATUS / TO-DO
==============

This code is very raw and smells.

At the moment and needs to have redundancies extracted, more data needs to be pumped
through  the test suite to make sure that the output is consistently proper.

NOTES
=====

* use 'j' instead of consonantal 'i'  This code simply can't sort that one
out.
